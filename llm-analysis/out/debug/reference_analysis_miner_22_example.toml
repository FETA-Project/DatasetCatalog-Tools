Abstract—Machine learning (ML) represents an efficient and popular approach for network traffic classification. However, network traffic inspection is a challenging domain and trained models may degrade soon after deployment. Besides biases present during data captures and model creation, data drifts contribute significantly to ML model degradation. This paper proposes a novel method called Model-based Feature Weight Drift Detection (MFWDD) for concept drift detection. It is a part of a public software framework suited for dataset drift analysis tailored to the domain of network traffic. This work addresses TLS and QUIC service classification problems, ex- amines a variety of experiments analyzing the evolution of the respective distributions, and observes their degradation over time on different ML features. The MFWDD framework guided TLS and QUIC services classification models retraining throughout an extensive period and not only prevented model degradation but also improved its performance and consistency over time.

Abstract—Recent network traffic classification methods benefit from machine learning (ML) technology. However, there are many challenges due to the use of ML, such as lack of high-quality annotated datasets, data drifts and other effects causing aging of datasets and ML models, high volumes of network traffic, etc. This paper presents the benefits of augmenting traditional workflows of ML training&deployment and adaption of the Active Learning (AL) concept on network traffic analysis. The paper proposes a novel Active Learning Framework (ALF) to address this topic. ALF provides prepared software components that can be used to deploy an AL loop and maintain an ALF instance that continuously evolves a dataset and ML model automatically. Moreover, ALF includes monitoring, datasets quality evaluation, and optimization capabilities that enhance the current state of the art in the AL domain. The resulting solution is deployable for IP flow-based analysis of high-speed (100Gb/s) networks, where it was evaluated for more than eight months. Additional use cases were evaluated on publicly available datasets.

proposals (published after 2017) using public research paper databases such as Google Scholar, IEEE Explore, and ACM Digital Library. We went through more than 300 papers and selected the best-performing proposals that met the follow- ing conditions ensuring fair comparability: 1) it was a flow- based method, 2) it uses the dataset as a whole and clas- sifies all the dataset classes and types of samples, 3) does not use IP addresses as input features7, 4) does not combine the concerned dataset with additional data. The selected best- performing proposals for both binary or multiclass versions of the classification tasks for each dataset are written in Table II.
to tune the following hyperparameters: n_estimators, max_depth, gamma, reg_alpha, min_child_weight, and colsample_bytree.
The hyperparameter search was performed using the training and validation datasets. The best values of the hyperparameters were selected based on the F1-score measure on the validation dataset. The final performance of the classifier on each dataset was obtained from the model trained using the trained part and evaluated on the test part. The test part was not used during any stage of the classifier design, ensuring the fairness of model evaluation on data that was not seen before.
VI. FEATURE EVALUATION
A. Results
We evaluated the features by creating a novel classifier for each concerned network classification task. The classifier creation pipeline is the set of steps that creates the best final model. At first, the published datasets were split among Train, Validation, and Test sets in a ratio of 60:20:20 while keeping the labeling ratio like in the original datasets. Furthermore, some additional value sanitation is recommended, e.g., for a very short time series, it is required to handle “NaN” values: we replace NaN for the distribution features with 0.5, for the frequency features with -1, and

Nevertheless, the packet aggregation into flow records naturally causes information loss; therefore, this paper proposes a novel flow extension for traffic features based on the time series analysis of the Single Flow Time series, i.e., a time series created by the number of bytes in each packet and its timestamp. We propose 69 universal features based on the statistical analysis of data points, time domain analysis, packet distribution within the flow timespan, time series behavior, and frequency domain analysis. We have demonstrated the usabil- ity and universality of the proposed feature vector for various network traffic classification tasks using 15 well-known publicly available datasets. Our evaluation shows that the novel feature vector achieves classification performance similar or better than related works on both binary and multiclass classification tasks. In more than half of the evaluated tasks, the classification per- formance increased by up to 5 %.

This paper is organized as follows: Section II summarizes the related works. Section III describes the periodic behavior of mining activity. Section IV provides information about time series analysis concepts and describes a novel detection ap- proach to periodic cryptocurrency mining behavior. Section V provides a complete description of features used for detection. Section VI describes the entire classification pipeline and its results. Section VII describes the cooperation with the DeCrypto system and shows the achieved improvement of the system. Section VIII concludes this paper.
II. RELATED WORKS
Basic principle for network detection are block-lists, for example [10] for cryptomining. However, each domain or IP address can host multiple services, making block-list- based detection unreliable [11], [12]. Moreover, block-lists can never be complete and suffer from a high false-positive rate. Therefore, multiple studies have proposed mining detection using various other approaches.
Our work enhances the DeCrypto system and provides another data source to further minimize false positives and support high accuracy and precision. The proposed classifier aims to detect the periodic behavior of cryptominers by utilizing FTS analysis.
III. PERIODICITY BEHAVIOR OF CRYPTOCURRENCY MINERS
Functionality of cryptomining software is pretty straight- forward. Firstly, a miner connects to a mining pool or a crypto network to fetch an unverified block. Then, the miner starts generating hashes of header of this block together with a nonce (number used only once). When the miner finds a hash string that starts with a certain number of leading zeros (difficulty), the hash is considered correct and verified, and the completed block is broadcasted back to the mining pool or crypto network. The whole process starts again — the miner is fetching a new unverified block. Furthermore, the miner can receive a notification that the currently processed block was already verified by someone else. Miner then has to fetch a new block.
Swedan et al. [13] proposed Mining Detection and Pre- vention System (MDPS). Their system uses URL block lists, Man-In-The-Middle proxy, and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). Decrypted payloads are inspected by mining code detectors and VirusTotal5 is used for detection of malicious JavaScript libraries. Unfortunately, it is impossible to use MITM proxies and DPI on high-speed ISP-level networks due to technical difficulties. Moreover, concerns about users’ privacy may rise. ˇZ´adn´ık et al. [14] proposed a detection solution that uses flow-based features and ML for primary cryptominers identifi- cation and active probing as a 


ll satisfy the network’s difficulty as well. Therefore, communication will occur more often. However, it is enough for periodicity detection.
IV. PERIODICITY DETECTION
We need the FTS with minimal noise for periodic behavior detection. Every FTS has to contain flows from the one process only; for example, YouTube video streaming, web- page loading, Keep-Alive communication or cryptomining communication. Because of this, we create FTS by sampling with Network dependencies [6]. A network dependency is a relationship between two IP addresses where one provides a service to the other. Furthermore, each network dependency has an ID created as ip_addr:port-ip_addr, where the port is well-known or registered and represents the service. Furthermore, some processes, like cryptocurrency miners, use non-registered ports. For such cases, it is necessary to use time series as ip_addr:port-ip_addr:port and apply detection of such ports in post-processing of FTS collection. For cryptominers from the CESNET-MINER22 dataset [8], such ports are 12433, 14433, 14444, and 20535.
Compared to related works, DeCrypto is the only system which was deployed and evaluated on such large network.
The network dependencies were evaluated as the best choice for sampling [6], causing minimal noise and occurring with

the best result of periodic behavior detection. For example, the sample only by relationship between two IP addresses ended significantly worse because multiple processes can share one public IP address.
z = max(PLS) ∗ Significance level
The probability that z is bigger then rest of periodogram
In the FTS collection, we experimented with multiple time windows to evaluate deployment properties into real-time networks, for example, into ISP network CESNET2 side-by- side the DeCrypto system. We set the time windows, i.e., FTS length, from 10 minutes to 24 hours.
Because the FTS are Unevenly Sampled Time Series (USTS), we use the Lomb-Scargle periodogram [16]–[18], PLS, as a source of information for deciding whether the FTS contains periodic behavior.
The method for detection of periodic behavior is based on our previous work [4]. However, it is not feasible for high- speed ISP networks because it can process only a small num- ber of time series per second, and thus optimizations would be required. A novel and faster periodicity detection pipeline presented in Fig. 1 is designed for high-speed networks. This pipeline is able to process the whole CESNET-MINER22 dataset (containing 3 million flows obtained during 3 months) in 5 seconds with proper precision based on two threshold values of Scargle’s Significance Test (SST) [19].
powers PLS is computed by the equation:
P [PLS > z] = 1 − e
− z σ2
PLS
If P [PLS > z] is larger or equal to threshold value Per- centage level, then the time series contains periodic behavior. In this work, we evaluate the classification results based on the settings of threshold values Significance level and Percentage level. Furthermore, the smaller Significance level is, the more strict is the periodic detection. Moreover, the bigger Percentage level is, the more strict is periodic detection. the same datapoint occurs periodically, periodic detection by LS peri- odogram and SST can fail. So, we test if FTS is constant and, in such case it is taken as periodic. Moreover, the periodic behavior detection pipeline can cause false positives for short FTS. Thus, we run the pipeline only for the FTS with at least ten datapoints.
Furthermore, for FTS that are constant,

VI. CLASSIFICATION BASED ON PERIODIC FEATURES
A. Creating datasets
Fig. 2. Example of FTS with the Clear periodic behavior
As we mentioned before, we experiment with the length of FTS by defining the time interval in which FTS are collected. The chosen time intervals are: 24h, 12h, 6h, 4h, 2h, 1h, 30m, 15m, and 10m. The IP flows were taken from the CESNET-MINER22 dataset, which was created by monitor- ing the CESNET28 network infrastructure by ipfixprobe9 — open-source flow exporter. The computed FTS created from the CESNET-MINER22 dataset and the datasets of periodic behaviors have been published on Zenodo [9].
Fig. 3. Example of FTS with the Sinusoidal periodic behavior
The number of created FTS depends on the size of the time interval. In the top left graph of Fig. 4, the number of FTS increases with the decreasing time interval. The number of constant FTS achieved the same trend as it can be seen on the left bottom graph of Fig. 4. However, the top right graph of Fig. 4 shows the number of tested FTS with at least ten datapoints, and it is not increasing with the same trend.

Kurtosis is computed as K =

Furthermore, we use the Lomb-Scargle periodogram to generate the set of well-known frequency-based features listed below:
Min power, Max power — Represent the minimum and maximum power of the LS periodogram.
Frequency of min power, Frequency of max power — Describe the frequency of the minimum and maximum power of the LS periodogram.
Spectral bandwidth — Describes the difference between upper and lower frequencies at which spectral energy is half its maximum value.
Spectral centroid — Indicates at which frequency the energy of a spectrum is centred upon.
The number of periodic FTS depends on the settings of Scargle’s Significance Test (SST), i.e., Significance level and Percentage level. The right bottom graph of Fig. 4 shows the numbers of periodic FTS for each tested setting. The number of periodic FTS with Significance level equals to 0.1 has the same trend as the number of tested FTS. The number of periodic FTS with Significance level equals to 0.01 has decreasing trend with decreasing time intervals. And the number of periodic FTS with Significance level equal to 0.001 has a slightly increasing trend with decreasing time intervals. If we realize that the longer the time interval, the more accurate the periodicity test should be, and we observed the behavior just described, we can conclude that the correct SST setting should be Significance level equal to 0.01. Furthermore, we performed experiments with the settings of SST in classi- fication to obtain the best classification results (the following sections provide further information).
Spectral energy — Represents the total energy present at all frequencies in LS periodogram.
Spectral entropy — The degree of randomness or disor- der in the LS periodogram.
Spectral flatness — Estimates the uniformity of signal energy distribution in the frequency domain.
Spectral flux — The rate of change of periodogram power with increasing frequency.
The classification pipeline uses only flows from periodic FTS. The number of classified flows from non-periodic FTS is shown in Fig. 5. This figure shows results with SST Signif- icance level set to 0.01 a


y et al. [8] split the CESNET- MINER22 dataset into the Design and Evaluation parts. The Design part is for creating, tuning and selecting the best model and the Evaluation part is for the one-time evaluation of the best model from the Design part. This default split avoids overfitting and allows comparison of results with other works without variation by random sampling.
Spectral zero crossing rate — Refers to the rate of shift of the sign of a wave, which is the rate of change from negative to positive or the reverse.

In the design phase, we start with selection of the opti- mal ML algorithm by testing 11 well-known ML algorithms from which XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost algorithms achieved similar results. We choose the XGBoost algorithm. Our experiments ended similarly on each dataset.
After selecting the algorithm, we optimized the hyperparam- eters to get a suitable set that performs well on the dataset, yet does not cause overfitting. We use the hyperopt library [20] to tune the following hyperparameters: n estimators, max depth, gamma, reg alpha, reg lambda, min child weight, and col- sample bytree. This tuning phase results in the best settings of hyperparameters of the XGBoost classifier. We picked the best models in the design phase. The best models for each time interval were selected based on the evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
After the design phase, we evaluate selected models on the Evaluation part of the CESNET-MINER22 dataset. Source code of the classification pipeline and experiments are pub- lished on GitHub10.
C. Results of classification
The best results for settings Significance level equal to 0.1 and Percentage level equal to 0.9 are presented in Table I. As can be seen, the periodic features are more than suitable for cryptocurrency miners detection. Moreover, no False positives occur for each time interval.
Fig. 6. Feature importance
The results of the feature importance investigation for the trained model are shown in Fig. 6. We can see that the Clear periodic behavior features are one of the least important, but they cause a low false-positive rate as described by Koumar et al. [4].
For the deployment of the augmented DeCrypto system into networks for real-time detection, it is crucial to choose a proper time interval for FTS sampling and proper settings of the SST test. However, the best achieved results, presented in Table I, can not be used for selecting proper time interval because most of them achieved similar results. Moreover, the results can be strongly influenced by variation caused by the randomness that naturally occurs in splitting, training and tuning of ML models [21]. We evaluated the classification pipeline for each time interval 100 times. The results of

Abstract—While the popularity of cryptocurrencies and the whole industry’s value are rising, the number of threat actors who use illegal “coin miner malware” is increasing as well. The threat actors commonly use computational resources of companies, research and educational institutions, or end users. In this paper, we analyzed the long-term periodic behavior of the cryptocurrency miners communicating in computer networks. We propose a novel method for cryptominers detection using specially designed periodicity features. The detection algorithm is based on the mathematical detection of periodic Flow time series (FTS) and feature mining. Altogether with the Machine Learning technique, the resulting system achieves high-precision performance. Furthermore, our approach enhances a flow-based cryptominers detection system DeCrypto to further improve its reliability and feasibility for high-speed networks.

Abstract—Network traffic classification and analysis are cru- cial for maintaining computer security. Nevertheless, the rise of encrypted traffic has made reliable threat detection increasingly challenging, requiring more complex algorithms such as heteroge- neous ensembles. These types of algorithms proved to be effective in complex threat detection while maintaining high accuracy and explainability. However, their complexity and time-consuming development process limit their widespread adoption. Therefore, we created a new library called Weak Indication Framework (WIF) for the faster development of heterogeneous ensembles, which minimizes the time between attack discovery and detection capability. Moreover, WIF-based detectors are efficient enough to operate on large Internet Service Provider networks—a single detector can protect millions of users. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the WIF library through four different detectors (TOR, Cryptomining, IoT Malware, and Tunnel detector), each achieving outstanding performance and quick deployment times. Index Terms—network security, traffic analysis, threat detecneous ensembles and shorten the deployment time of emerging threat detectors.
WIF is a novel library containing the essential primitive blocks that can be reused in the detection pipelines. Apart from multiple classifiers (such as regular expression, Machine Learning, blocklist, and more) and results-fusion functions, WIF also has storage capabilities to store detection context for a longer time period.

complexity in mind when designing the feature vector, to ensure the possibility of practical deployment.
However, the data can be used without aggregation. That means a time series of observations {𝑋𝑛} = {𝑥1,𝑥2,…,𝑥𝑛} taken at times {𝑇𝑛} = {𝑡1,𝑡2,…,𝑡𝑛} does not have constant 𝛿𝑗 = 𝑡𝑗+1 − 𝑡𝑗,∀𝑗 ∈ {1,…,𝑛 − 1}. This type of time series is called unevenly (or unequally/ irregularly) spaced.
4.2. Network traffic classification using time series analysis
The benefit of an unevenly spaced time series can be seen in Fig. 2, where each traffic type generates different patterns of packet sizes in time. These patterns can be captured by time series analysis [27]; thus, time series analysis features are an ideal candidate for a universal feature vector.
The unevenly-spaced time series from network traffic does not require any aggregation; moreover, they do not contain any trends and seasonality [27], which makes them more suitable for network traffic classification. Since there is already an advanced mathemati- cal theory around unevenly-spaced time series (mainly in astronomy and medicine), we can use the mathematical methods and tools for their analysis to form a feature vector describing the properties of the communication and use it for network traffic classification [26]. Nevertheless, we also need to keep the computational and memory

If they are all in the direction from the source to the destination, then the percentage is 100%; if they are all from the destination to the source, then the percentage is 0%.

The test part was not used during any stage of the classifier design, ensuring the fairness of model evaluation on data that was not seen before.

using the previously defined metrics. For each metric, a higher value means better performance of the classifier; both accuracy and F1 score metrics are considered in the evaluation separately. Moreover, we also compare the performance with our previously published results (TSA of SFTS) [26], to show the comparison between two types of universal time-series-based features.
6.1. Classification results
6.1.1. Binary classification
The results of binary classification are graphically presented in Fig. 4. We also provide detailed results in Appendix, in Tables A.8 and B.10.
In this section, we present classification performance on 25 network classification tasks using 15 publicly available and well-known network traffic datasets (listed in Table 2). The tasks can be separated into 15 binary classification tasks, 8 multiclass classification tasks, and two special multiclass classification tasks. The performance of

1% increase in accuracy measure or F1 score compared to related works. Our approach achieves more than 1% increase in problems of detecting cryptomining, IoT malware, intrusion, and VPN. Especially, the detection of crypto mining using the CESNET-MINER22 dataset and VPN using the ISCX-VPN-2016 dataset achieves a better F1 score by more than 5%. Nevertheless, with the TOR detection problem and Intrusion detection on the UNSW-NB-15 dataset, we observed a slightly worse F1 score than the best-performing classifier from the related works.
When we compare the Enhanced NetTiSA discriminative perfor- mance with universal Time-Series Analysis features (TSA of SFTS) from our previous work [26], we can see (in Fig. 4) that the re- sults are mostly similar. The TSA of SFTS features show significantly better discriminative performance (when concerning the F1-score) in the ISCX-VPN-2016 and UNSW-NB-15 datasets. On the other hand, the NetTiSA is significantly better on the CESNET-MINER22 dataset. The overall comparison of the binary classification is summarized in Table 3.
We investigated the related work of Intrusion detection on the UNSW-NB-15 dataset. The classifier published by Nawir et al. [71] indeed performed significantly better by the means of F1-score (by 5.75%), but their accuracy is significantly worse than that of our approach (by 4.85%). The increased F1 score can be attributed to the application-layer-based features (such as from HTTP headers) that would not be applicable in encrypted traffic analysis.
6.1.2. Multiclass classification
The results of multiclass classification are presented in Fig. 5. Fur- thermore, the detailed results are also presented in the Appendix, Tables A.9, B.11, B.12, B.13, B.14, B.15, B.16, B.17, and B.18. Similarly, as in binary classification, the Enhanced NetTiSA features proved to be discriminatory in the multiclass classification. It outperformed most of the best-performing classifiers proposed in related works (listed in Table 1). Specifically, in five out of eight cases (botnet families, IoT malware families, intrusion type, and VPN traffic type), we achieved more than a 1% classification performance increase compared to best- performing related works. Especially, the classification of intrusion type with NetTiSA features extracted from the UNSW-NB15 dataset achieves a better F1 score by more than 15%. However, we observed a slight decrease in two cases—TON_IoT and TOR classification.
We also investigated the difference between the TOR classifier published by Dai et al. [69], which extends flow data for the first 32 packets and also 600 bytes of payload. The payload information gives their classifier an advantage since the classifier can fit the unencrypted TLS handshake data. Since TOR usually does not use some common TLS extensions, e.g., Server Name Indication, the TOR TLS handshakes in the dataset are specific and easily recognizable by payload-based analysis. The raw payload data gives Dai et al. an advantage, but also result in much larger flow records (as shown in the next section).

Table A.9 Comparison of results of multiclass classification based on Enhanced NetTiSA feature set with best-related work on the same dataset. We compare results by Accuracy in %, Macro average F1-score in %, and Weighted average F1-score in %. The Telemetry column represents the size of the flow extension (the classical flow has an extension size equal to zero). The green background colour marks fields where classification based on the NetTiSA flow is at least 1% better than the best-related work. The red background colour marks fields where classification based on the NetTiSA flow is at least 1% worse than the best-related work. The grey background colour marks the rest fields.

Network traffic monitoring based on IP Flows is a standard monitoring approach that can be deployed to various network infrastructures, even the large ISP networks connecting millions of people. Since flow records traditionally contain only limited information (addresses, transport ports, and amount of exchanged data), they are also commonly extended by additional features that enable network traffic analysis with high accuracy.
