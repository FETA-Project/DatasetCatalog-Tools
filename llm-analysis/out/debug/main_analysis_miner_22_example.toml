search_document: Step 1. Creating the initial anonymity set.
Let Pui be the set of potential pseudonyms for ui (anonymity set). Initially, it includes every pj that publish messages in rx for the first time while at the same time ui is online for the first time as well. Additionally, pj has published the same or a fewer amount of messages compared to the number of messages sent by ui, i.e., Mpj
≤ Mui.
Intersection Attacks on Anonymous Microblogging
Step 2. Verifying whether p(cid:3) is in Pui.

search_document: Figure2 shows a simple example of the proposed method. In this example, we assume a group of four users U = {u1,u2,u3,u4} publishing during four rounds R = {r1,r2,r3,r4}, and the goal is to determine each user’s pseudonym. A can learn the following over each round:
r1: Pu1 = {p2,p3}, Pu2 = {p2,p3}, Pu3 = {p2,p3} ◦ r2: Pu1 = {p1,p3,p4}, Pu2 = {p2}, Pu3 = {p1,p3,p4}, Pu4 = {p1,p4} ◦ r3: Pu1 = {p1,p3,p4}, Pu2 = {p2}, Pu3 = {p1,p3}, Pu4 = {p1,p4} ◦ r4: Pu1 = {p1}, Pu2 = {p2}, Pu3 = {p3}, Pu4 = {p4}

search_document: Pui: – it is online while ui is offline. – Mpl – it is offline while ui is online and the number of online users is the same as the number of online pseudonyms, i.e., p(cid:3) is definitely online in this particular round. (When this happens, the flag f must be set to true.)
> Mui.
(b) If ui is online and f is false, A adds to Pui every pseudonym pj that is
online for the first time, and Mpj
≤ Mui.
Step 4. Repeat Step 3 until: pseudonym (p(cid:3)).
the flag f is true and Pui contains only one

search_document: A compares the total number of online users to the total number of online pseudonyms during rx. If they are equal, it means all online users published real messages, so Pui definitely includes p(cid:3). In such a case, a flag f is set to true, which indicates that no new pseudonyms can be added to Pui.
Step 3. Updating Pui during every subsequent round.
(a) Every pl that fulfills one of the following conditions will be removed from

search_document: rounds. In other words, A can track pseudonyms in Pui which are online while ui is offline and excludes them from Pui which might lead to faster convergence:

search_document: microblogging. We use real-world datasets from Twitter and Red- dit to simulate realistic user communication behavior. We launch the attack to reveal the identity of the publishing user (i.e., de-anonymize the user), hence the posts and messages can be linked to the sending user. Using an intersection attack for the other direction, i.e., to discover which topic a user subscribed to is beyond our scope1.

The delay, like in the first attack, is shown to be a better countermeasure than cover traffic. For example, if the userbase size is 10,000 and the maximum delay is 3 hours, the percentage of the de-anonymized users is reduced from 57% to 25%. While using five cover messages for each real message (i.e., 5:1) can only decrease the

search_document: We believe that answering these questions is critical to understand how and under what conditions intersection attacks are powerful. Additionally, this under- standing can facilitate and enhance the development of effective mitigation mea- sures to protect against intersection attacks in practical ACSs. In this paper, we address the aforementioned questions by investigating intersection attacks on two different messaging patterns: pseudonym-based and topic-based messaging of anonymous

search_document: Overall, the user-pseudonym linking attack is far more effective than the user- topic linking attack. That is mainly for two reasons. First, it is due to the many- to-many relationship between users and topics, whereas users and pseudonyms have a one-to-one relationship. The user may publish on various topics every round, and each topic can get messages from different users over rounds. The second reason is that some of the topics can be active for the majority of the time. Thus, it is

search_document: In this work, we consider an anonymous microblogging system that has a set of users U = {u1,u2,...un}. Each user, ui ∈ U, can independently decide how many messages to send, and when to send them. Thus, there are no agreements on com- munication behavior between users, which is closest to commonly used existing non-anonymous microblogging systems. All messages transmitted between users and the system are encrypted and padded to the same length i.e., they appear indistinguishable to any external

search_document: 1 It is noteworthy that a solution for this intersection attack direction has been addressed already by utilising broadcasting of published messages, i.e., sending every published message to all users, as seen in [1,4,5]. Nonetheless, broadcasting imposes a high communication overhead on users, which makes it an inefficient solution. Thus, more research in this area is clearly needed.

Then, in Sect.3, we present our intersection attack for each messaging pattern. Following that, in Sect.4, we discuss the evaluation results of our experiments. Finally, Sect.5 concludes the paper and presents some points for future work.

According to our findings, sending random cover traffic increases the number of required observed rounds. However, it can only slightly reduce the number of de-anonymized users by the end of the observation period. For example, if users randomly send 10 dummy messages for every real message (i.e., ratio 10:1)—that definitely leads to high

We think that the main reason behind the ineffectiveness of cover traffic in protecting the users is the randomness in generating and sending the dummy messages, which seems incapable of creating anonymity sets that can provide long-term protection for the users’ pseudonyms.

That is because nearly 60% of users in the Twitter dataset post more than 100 messages, whereas there are only about 25% of users in the Reddit dataset who have similar sending rates, see Fig.4. In the Reddit dataset, for example, there are only five users who have sent more than 1,000 messages. The communication behaviors of these five users are also noticeably different, making it difficult to conceal each one’s behavior using delay. Nonetheless, it appears that cover

search_document: In Fig.7(a) and Fig.7(b), we illustrate how delaying messages can help in degrading the effectiveness of the user-pseudonym linking attack. Since the adversary cannot learn the exact number of rounds for which a message has been delayed, it treats every message as if it has been postponed by d rounds. That results in very large anonymity sets, hence, it reduces the attack perfor- mance. Using the delay is more powerful on Twitter than on Reddit, especially for users with sending rate of more
